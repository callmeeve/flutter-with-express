## Task App with Flutter and Express

This project is a task management application built using Flutter for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, including creating, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

### Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely to access their tasks.
- Task management: Users can create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- Real-time updates: Changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all users viewing the same task.

### Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
